Pseudocode 1

1. Define variables for the number of students, mininum and maximum grades, collection of marks, and sum of the grades so that the average can be calculated
2. Receive the marks through user input, signaling when they enter a mark that is not valid 
3. When a valid mark is entered, add to the marks collection
4. compare each grade with current min and max grades and replace accordingly
5. After all grades were corrently received, print min and max values

Pseudocode 2
1. After all grades were received, calculate the mean/average by divididng the summation of all valid grades by the number of students
2. With the mean, calculate the total variance by the sum of the square difference between each grade and the mean. 
varianceTotal += Math.pow(mark - mean, 2);
3. With the total variance, the standard deviation can be determined by the square root of the division of the total variance by the number of students
standardDeviation = Math.sqrt(varianceTotal / numberOfStudents)

4. Output values for the mean, and standard variation to the user
